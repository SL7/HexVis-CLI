HexVis - CLI Hex Visualizer

This is a simple Hex visualizer for every kind of file.  
This is a one day project and will be improved later on.  

Note that I'm not that experienced in C for now so if I can improve my code, I would be glad to get some advice :D

## Install

To install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SL7/HexVis-CLI.git

cd HexVis-CLI/
```
Before you run `make` remove everything inside the `bin/` folder

```
make                                                        // Warnings might occur, just ignore

bin/hexvis -h
```

Now the executable called `hexvis` is in the `bin/` folder.  
Just add it to the PATH and you are ready to go.
